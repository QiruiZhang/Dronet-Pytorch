# Dronet Pytorch


This code follows the Dronet paper as well as the datasets found on the Github repo.

The whole training and testing pipeline is built for Pytorch (the original paper's code is in Tensorflow)

## Setup

First, you will want to create the correct directories for your work with training, testing, and validation.

## TBD..

More details on how to run are coming!!
